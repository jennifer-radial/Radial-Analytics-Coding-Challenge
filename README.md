# Radial-Analytics-Coding-Challenge
The python script should intake the given csv file and perform a series of calculations on it before outputting a new csv file.
The code will also take the same csv file and output the correlation between overall hospital quality and mortality and readmission rate. (see below for analysis)
Code was written primarily for maximum readability and quality rather than speed.
The code can be run in the command line assuming the given data is held in the same folder.
Code is commented prior to each major action to give updates on what is being performed.

Note on correlation:
The analysis shows that the overall value of readmission rate and mortality rate has a .61 correlation with overall quality rate.
As a result, although this value is not perfectly correlated, I would say it is safe to say that there is some truth to the belief that the overall quality rate is a useful measurement.
More precise data would be needed to understand this fully as a 1 to 5 rating scheme leaves a large amount of room for nuance to be lost.
